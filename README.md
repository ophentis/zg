node + express


Packages
==

some package to consider to use later on

async - Great library for keeping yourself out of "callback hell". As you dive deeper into Node, you'll find yourself loving this one IMHO.

config - Very simple module for setting up easy config files, supports js, json or yaml configs

node-cache - Quick and simple node in memory caching solution

mongoose - I believe this is the goto MongoDB driver. Like you mentioned with MySQL and RSS, there are a bunch of choices but this one appears to be the most robust.
